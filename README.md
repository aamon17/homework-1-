## Recomendations 
If i were to work with coinbase i would try and implement roboadvising on your crypto portfolio, this would help you have a hands off approach while still being able to make money. 
This would benifit the company because while the market is ever changing, with a roboadvisor keeping track of you portfolio it would be able to sell and buy when deemed fit instead of relying on your own intutiton to buy, sell, trade. 
The technology this would utilize would include, machine learning and A.I. To keep track of the market. 
These technologies would be appropriate because if you wanted to fully become hand of you could run code to the machine or A.I and tell it when to buy or sell.
